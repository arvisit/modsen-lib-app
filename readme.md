# Library App

Test task microservices REST application that imitates a library and provides an API for anonymous users to view info about books in the catalog, for authorized users to view lists of books which are available, borrowed and to borrow available ones, for authorized administrators to manage books catalog, i.e. perform CRUD operations, change borrowed books status to available, view info about particular borrowed book. When a new book is added to the catalog it automatically becomes available to borrow.

## Project structure

Project consists of modules located in separate GitHub repositories attached to the current repository as submodules which also are parts of the Maven parent project to make it easier to import the whole project into an IDE.

### Submodules

+ [Api gateway](https://github.com/arvisit/modsen-api-gateway) - service to provide a single entrypoint to API
+ [Book service](https://github.com/arvisit/modsen-book-service) - service to provide access to book info catalog
+ [Config server](https://github.com/arvisit/modsen-config-server) - service to provide configuration for the rest services depending on an active profile
+ [Configs](https://github.com/arvisit/modsen-configs) - GitHub repository as a projects configs storage used by Config server
+ [Discovery server](https://github.com/arvisit/modsen-discovery-server) - service to automate another services discovery
+ [Exception handling starter](https://github.com/arvisit/modsen-exception-handling-starter) - Spring Boot Starter to provide autoconfiguration of Beans which are supposed to handle basic and security exception in a Spring Boot Application, uses its GitHub repository as a Maven repository to download artifact
+ [Inner filter starter](https://github.com/arvisit/modsen-inner-filter-starter) - Spring Boot Starter to provide autoconfiguration of Beans which are supposed to secure an application by interacting with Security service, uses its GitHub repository as a Maven repository to download artifact
+ [Library service](https://github.com/arvisit/modsen-library-service) - service to provide access to available/borrowed books info and ability to borrow available books for authorized users
+ [Security service](https://github.com/arvisit/modsen-security-service) - service to provide security for the entire Library App via JWT tokens

## Installation

### Prerequisites

+ ssh
+ git
+ Docker
+ docker compose

### Actual installation

Run the following commands to clone the repository together with submodules, build docker images and run containers:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:arvisit/modsen-lib-app.git
cd modsen-lib-app
docker compose up --build
```

It will take some time to download all dependencies and build images. Be patient.

## Usage

### Introduction

Usage of the Library App endpoints can be performed via following `curl` requests or via [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8080/webjars/swagger-ui/index.html)

**Note!** Some of the bellow requests contain placeholder `<TOKEN>` for the JWT token. To successfully perform these requests actual token should be provided. To obtain a token, user should [authenticate](#security-service) himself via username and password. This token should be transfered within header 'Authorization' as 'Bearer <TOKEN>' like this:

```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJuZXdfdXNlckBtYWlsLmNvbSIsImlhdCI6MTcwNzUyMTQ4MiwiZXhwIjoxNzA3NTI1MDgyLCJhdXRob3JpdGllcyI6WyJST0xFX1VTRVIiXX0.FE2f8fXkz4MtFz7iq_dvYolcQ3JazrK04NnJIA3OIw7xjgOX7GC5kjnieCi9DZvzuHz0KhCt3NMWTDS0-Fghvg
